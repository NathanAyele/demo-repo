# Significance of Findings and Future Work

[.](./ "mention")

[proposed-methods.md](proposed-methods.md "mention")

The proposed study puts us in a position where we have TouchDev, a heuristically evaluated and developed touch-based IDE ready and approved by IRB to be tested by participants. The participants will include novice computer science students or individuals who have limited experience with coding and application development. The independent variable in the proposed future study will be the development method (TouchDev vs Scratch vs traditional text-based programming). The dependent variables will include both subjective and objective measures, including performance (i.e., project success and coding efficiency), experience, perception and the themes and patterns in the responses.

The findings from this study have the potential to inform the development of new tools and approaches for teaching and learning coding and application development. If TouchDev is found to be more effective than the existing alternatives, it could lead to development of more touch-based coding interfaces that cater to a broader range of individuals, including those traditionally barred from software development due to financial constraints or physical disabilities. Additionally, if TouchDev is found to be effective in generating JavaScript code for building real and applicable web-apps, it could have major implications for existing developers, reducing the time and effort required for coding and debugging.

In conclusion, the findings of this study have the potential to benefit developers, educators, and individuals interested in starting out coding and application development, especially those who find traditional text-based interfaces and coding challenging or intimidating, making coding and application development easier and more accessible.
