The proposed summer research will comprise four steps. First, the aim is to develop TouchDev IDE with minimum testable capabilities – starting/saving/loading projects, adding/moving/deleting code blocks, declaring/setting variables, text input and output. Second, the plan is to execute an internal heuristic evaluation of the TouchDev user interface and experience. Third, the IDE will be tweaked based on the results from the heuristic evaluation. Finally, the work will focus on experiment design and a written proposal for the IRB (internal review board) for a larger follow-up study that compares ease and effectiveness of TouchDev against other visual coding and traditional text-based IDEs for learning coding and application development.

The first few stages of this project focus on developing TouchDev. It will be a web application written using JavaScript language and u1.js, a JavaScript library for display and interacting with web applications using UINL \[4]. This web-based visual IDE will enable users to add and edit code by just tapping on the options, avoiding typing and dragging as much as possible. User inputs will be stored as a JSON object that can be saved and loaded, transcompiled into JavaScript, and deployed as a fully functional web application.&#x20;

The developed prototype will be evaluated internally via a popular UI/UX usability methodology – a heuristic evaluation \[5]. This evaluation will help identify any usability issues that need to be addressed before the product is tested by a wider audience. Modifications and adjustments to the TouchDev IDE will be implemented based on the outcomes of the internal heuristic evaluation.

After the evaluation, the next step will be to test TouchDev's effectiveness as a visual programming IDE in comparison to existing IDEs and languages. To conduct a larger study, a proposal will be drafted and submitted to the IRB (internal review board). This proposal will outline the purpose of the study, the experiment design, and the potential benefits and risks for participants.
